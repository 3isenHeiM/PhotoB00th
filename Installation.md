# Installation

For the originsal project I used an Ordoid C2 instead of a RapsberryPi 3B+.

This is thus divide din to 2 parts :
* Installation on Odroid C2
* Installation on raspberry Pi

## Installation on Odroid C2

### Use RPi.GPIO

TO use the GPIOs on the Odroid C2, first we have to install a library to allow us tu ose the same libreary as for the Rapsberry Pi. Useful doc is (here)[https://github.com/jfath/RPi.GPIO-Odroid]
